# super-duper-carnival
programming for design assignment

I'm so sorry for the late submission. I misread the submission date and for the past week. I honestly have not been able to sit down at all because of work and other personal things that I've been trying to sort out amongst that.

I'm aware that I should have emailed regarding all of this with the submission and everything it just wasn't something that I particularly thought about.
