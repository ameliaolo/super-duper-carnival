programming for design assignment notes

I'm so sorry for the late submission. I misread the submission date and for the past week. I honestly have not been able to sit down at all because of work and other personal things that I've been trying to sort out amongst that.

I'm aware that I should have emailed regarding all of this with the submission and everything it just wasn't something that I particularly thought about.

I also had a ton of I guess confussion surrounding how this webpage worked - a lot of my work was deleted and had to be redone and saving things took a while to find out how to do and linking files, basically everything (including how to share this file...)
